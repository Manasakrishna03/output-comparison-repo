Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,"Lines 1-40","Both outputs implement Snowflake stored procedures for dynamic SQL execution with identical functional intent but different technical approaches. The snowconvert version uses SQL language with EXECUTE IMMEDIATE statements and includes EWI warnings, while the converted version uses JavaScript with snowflake.execute() calls for cleaner implementation."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 1-40","Both outputs achieve identical functional goals: executing dynamic UPDATE and INSERT statements. The core business logic and SQL operations are semantically equivalent, with only implementation language differences (SQL vs JavaScript)."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 8-40","Both follow stored procedure structure but differ significantly in implementation approach. Snowconvert uses SQL language with DECLARE/BEGIN/END blocks (lines 12-39), while converted uses JavaScript function structure (lines 14-20). Both execute same sequence of operations but with different syntax patterns."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,example2_manualEffort_dinamycSql_snowconvert,85,"Lines 18,21,24,27","Valid SQL syntax but contains multiple EWI warning comments that interrupt code flow. EXECUTE IMMEDIATE statements are syntactically correct. Missing quote escaping in line 16 ('test' should be '''test''')."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,example2_manualEffort_dinamycSql_converted,100,"Lines 14-20","Clean, syntactically correct JavaScript implementation. Proper string handling, correct snowflake.execute() syntax, and appropriate return statement. No syntax errors or warnings."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,92.5,,"Average of individual agent scores: (85 + 100) / 2 = 92.5"
