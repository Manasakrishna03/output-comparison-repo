Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,,Lines 1-45 vs 1-85,"Both outputs accomplish identical database operations on Employee table. example1_DmlAndDdl_converted provides clean SQL DDL/DML statements while example1_DmlAndDdl_BTEQ_snowconvert wraps equivalent operations in Python SnowConvert framework. Semantic intent is identical (95/100) with different structural approaches (75/100). Both are syntactically correct (100/100 each)."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,Lines 8-45 vs 25-85,"Both outputs perform identical sequence: CREATE Employee table with same schema (EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY, FirstName/LastName/Department/Email VARCHAR fields), INSERT 4 identical records (John Doe HR, Jane Smith Finance, Robert Brown IT, Lucy White Marketing), UPDATE EmployeeID=1 to Finance department, SELECT all records, DELETE EmployeeID=4, DROP table. Only differences: example1_DmlAndDdl_BTEQ_snowconvert adds database qualification (CRASHDUMPS.) and COLLATE clauses, uses CREATE OR REPLACE vs CREATE. Core business logic and data operations are semantically equivalent."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,Lines 1-45 vs 1-85,"Fundamental structural differences in implementation approach. example1_DmlAndDdl_converted uses direct SQL statements in linear sequence. example1_DmlAndDdl_BTEQ_snowconvert wraps each SQL operation in Python exec() calls within main() function, includes SnowConvert framework imports (lines 3-6), error handling (lines 79-80), and application lifecycle management. Both maintain same logical flow of operations but different execution paradigms - direct SQL vs Python-wrapped SQL."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,example1_DmlAndDdl_converted,100,,"Syntactically valid SQL DDL/DML statements. Proper table creation with constraints, valid INSERT syntax with all required fields, correct UPDATE with WHERE clause, valid SELECT statement, proper DELETE with WHERE condition, standard DROP TABLE syntax. No syntax errors, undefined references, or structural issues detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,example1_DmlAndDdl_BTEQ_snowconvert,100,,"Syntactically valid Python code with proper imports, function definitions, and SQL statements. All exec() calls contain valid Snowflake SQL syntax. Proper error handling with snowconvert.helpers.error_code checks. Valid Python structure with if __name__ == '__main__' pattern. No syntax errors, undefined variables, or broken references detected."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,100,,"Both outputs demonstrate perfect syntactic correctness for their respective environments. Average of individual scores: (100 + 100) / 2 = 100."

Recommendations,Recommendation,example1_DmlAndDdl_converted,,"Consider adding database/schema qualification for production environments. Add error handling and transaction management for robustness. Include comments explaining business logic and table purpose."
Recommendations,Recommendation,example1_DmlAndDdl_BTEQ_snowconvert,,"Remove hardcoded database name (CRASHDUMPS) and make configurable. Consider consolidating multiple single-row INSERTs into batch INSERT for efficiency. Add more granular error handling for individual operations rather than global check."
