Executive Summary,Narrative,Both,N/A,N/A,"Comparison of two database operation implementations: example1_DmlAndDdl_converted (pure SQL) vs example1_DmlAndDdl_BTEQ_snowconvert (Python with SnowConvert). Both outputs perform identical Employee table operations (CREATE, INSERT, UPDATE, SELECT, DELETE, DROP) with same data and business logic. Key difference is implementation approach - direct SQL statements vs Python wrapper with exec() calls. High semantic similarity (95/100) due to identical functionality, moderate structural similarity (75/100) due to different programming paradigms, and excellent correctness (100/100 and 95/100) with minor deductions for complexity in Python version."
Detailed Analysis,Semantic Similarity,Both,95,"Lines 8-40 vs Lines 20-80","Both outputs implement identical database operations with same Employee table schema (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Department, Email), identical data values, and same operational sequence. The semantic intent and business logic are virtually identical - creating employee records, updating John Doe's department to Finance, selecting all records, deleting Lucy White's record, and dropping the table. Minor deduction for different database targeting (generic SQL vs Snowflake-specific with CRASHDUMPS database and COLLATE clauses)."
Detailed Analysis,Structural Similarity,Both,75,"Lines 1-40 vs Lines 1-95","Different structural approaches: example1_DmlAndDdl_converted uses direct SQL statements in sequential order, while example1_DmlAndDdl_BTEQ_snowconvert wraps each SQL statement in Python exec() calls within a main() function. Both maintain the same logical flow: CREATE→INSERT(4x)→UPDATE→SELECT→DELETE→DROP. Deduction for different programming paradigms (declarative SQL vs procedural Python), different error handling approaches, and additional infrastructure code in Python version."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,example1_DmlAndDdl_converted,100,N/A,"Perfect SQL syntax with valid DDL/DML statements. All table references consistent, data types properly defined, PRIMARY KEY constraint correctly specified, INSERT statements have matching column/value counts, UPDATE and DELETE use proper WHERE clauses, SELECT statement is syntactically correct."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,example1_DmlAndDdl_BTEQ_snowconvert,95,"Lines 5-10, 85-90","Valid Python syntax with proper imports and function structure. SQL statements within exec() calls are syntactically correct. Minor deduction for complexity: multiple import statements that may not all be used (lines 5-7), and additional infrastructure code for error handling and application lifecycle (lines 85-90) that adds complexity without direct functional benefit."
Detailed Analysis,Correctness,Overall,98,N/A,"Average of individual correctness scores: (100 + 95) / 2 = 97.5, rounded to 98. Both outputs are highly correct with only minor issues in the Python implementation."

Recommendations,Recommendation,example1_DmlAndDdl_converted,N/A,N/A,"Excellent pure SQL implementation. Consider adding comments for better documentation and specify target database system for portability. The direct SQL approach is clean and maintainable."
Recommendations,Recommendation,example1_DmlAndDdl_BTEQ_snowconvert,N/A,"Lines 5-10, 20-25","Good SnowConvert migration output with proper error handling. Consider removing unused imports (lines 5-7) and adding more descriptive comments for the migration context. The database qualification (CRASHDUMPS.) should be parameterized for different environments."
Recommendations,Recommendation,Both,N/A,N/A,"Both implementations achieve the same business objective effectively. Choose example1_DmlAndDdl_converted for direct SQL execution environments, or example1_DmlAndDdl_BTEQ_snowconvert for automated migration scenarios requiring Python orchestration and error handling."
